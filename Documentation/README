 Camera 0.8
------------

Camera is a simple application to download files from a digital
camera. The files can be optionally deleted after download. During
download, a thumbnail of the currently downloaded file is displayed.

It is strongly recommended to read INSTALL for requirements before
you try to build and install Camera.

Bug reports, suggestions, code contributions etc. are welcome. Please
